    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <div class="about">
        <p class="about-intro">
            Our retreats are located on the Marshall’s private family farm,
            Elk Ridge Ranch in the Hoosier National Forest near French Lick, Indiana.   
            French Lick is well-known for it’s two historic hotels with world class spas 
            and mineral waters.  Cleansing retreats “sprung up” in French Lick 
            around the turn of the century.  Our location is about 110 miles from Indianapolis, 
            International Airport (IND) and Louisville Airport (SDF).

        <h1 class="dave-title">DAVE MARSHALL</h1>
        <h2 class="dave-subtitle">Founder/Owner/Director</h2>
        <p class="dave-bio">
            Dave founded the retreat alongside Wendy to continue a lifelong interest in personal fitness. Originally from Oregon, Dave began intensive physical training at the age of 18 and began professional personal training several years 
            later to supplement his income first as a deep-sea diver and underwater welder, then as a commercial pilot.  In 1990, Dave founded and built one of the largest cable & telecommunications marketing companies in Australia and the U.S. 
            But this financial success came at a physical cost, causing him to increase his weight from 160 lbs. to 240 lbs., largely the result of the excesses of corporate entertaining.
            Dave decided to reset his lifestyle at age 40 in 2000 to regain a balance in his life. He sold his firm and began traveling the world seeking health, fitness and martial arts training at various retreats and camps.
            In addition to regaining his peak physique, Dave recognized that raw and detox retreats he discovered overseas could be adapted for a western clientele to include fitness regimens and ‘going forward’ programming. 
            He developed the Detox Oasis signature retreats, with guidance from Dr. Matthew Andry, to blend these various training and weight loss methods into single- and multi-week programs.
            Dave also authored his first book in 2012, Marshall Law: Raw Foods to Red Meats. His book was written for his clients and is full of recipes from detox to meal packing muscle foods. Check it out at the link below!

        <h2 class="wendy-subtitle">Owner/Manager/CPT/YOGI</h2>
        <p class="wendy-bio">
            Wendy partnered with founder and husband, Dave Marshall, to launch the retreat in 2006 and has been actively involved in Detox Oasis and Fit Body Retreat daily operations from the start. Wendy left a career in telecommunications to pursue her 
            lifelong passion in fitness and wellness. In addition to running retreats, she manages the daily operations of the family’s 120-acre private ranch, Elk Ridge Ranch.
            Wendy has studied bodybuilding and personal training with nationally recognized Paul and Lisa Ray of Island Fitness in Miami, Florida and is a Parillo Performance Certified Personal Trainer. In addition, she has practiced yoga since 2007 and entered 
            yoga teacher training in 2013. Wendy has since completed her training as an RYT-200 at The Living Yoga Program in Austin, Texas. It is her belief that yoga is for everyone, so her goal is to offer entry level classes and a foundation for her clients to build a yoga practice.
            Wendy has also received her Reiki Master certification from Christine Eartheart at Heart Spirals in Bloomington, Indiana. She earned a Level 3 Pole Fitness Certification from Susan Hilferty at Pole Fitness in Miami, Florida and completed online courses 
            from KT Coates of Vertical Dance, Hertforshire, UK.  In addition to her diverse fitness background, Wendy has received personal counseling on foods and nutrition from Matthew Andry, MD of Andry Medical Services and MD Weight Worx in Bloomington, Indiana. Leveraging her own 
            personal experience, Wendy can help counsel clients with emotional eating disorders, hormone imbalances, diabetes, candida, and various thyroid and autoimmune issues and can guide clients on a path to better lifestyle habits and improved health and emotional wellbeing.
